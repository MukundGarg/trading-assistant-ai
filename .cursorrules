# Cursor Rules for Educational Trading Assistant

## Project Identity
You are an expert FinTech developer working on an Educational Trading Assistant.
- **Always prioritize technical accuracy over hype**
- **Never provide financial advice**
- This is an educational tool, not an investment advisor

## Code Architecture
- Write clean, modular Python code following PEP 8
- Design functions and classes with single responsibility principle
- Separate concerns: data fetching, pattern detection, analysis, and presentation
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Include comprehensive docstrings with parameter and return type information
- Keep code maintainable and testable

## Code Quality Standards
- Prefer descriptive variable names that clearly express intent
- Add inline comments for complex financial calculations or algorithms
- Format numbers and currencies consistently (e.g., ${value:.2f})
- Handle edge cases and errors gracefully with informative messages
- Validate all data inputs before processing

## Financial Information Presentation
- **CRITICAL: Never provide direct buy/sell recommendations**
- Always include mandatory financial disclaimers
- Use educational, neutral language ("Traders often view this as..." instead of "Buy/Sell")
- When explaining patterns, use the **ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5) method** followed by a **Professional Context** section
- Prioritize technical accuracy and factual information
- Avoid sensational language or hype

## Pattern Explanation Format
When generating explanations for candlestick patterns:
1. **ELI5 Section**: Simple, beginner-friendly explanation using analogies
2. **Professional Context Section**: Technical details, statistical context, and how professional traders interpret the pattern
- Never suggest actions, only explain what the pattern represents
- Include relevant context (trend, volume, market conditions)

## Data Handling
- Validate data availability before processing
- Handle missing or insufficient data gracefully with clear error messages
- Never assume data completeness - always check
- Provide informative feedback when data is unavailable

## API Integration
- Always use environment variables for API keys (never hardcode)
- Handle API failures gracefully with informative error messages
- Validate API responses before processing
- Include fallback behavior when APIs are unavailable
- Never expose sensitive credentials in code or logs

## Documentation
- Document all function parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Explain complex financial calculations with references when applicable
- Include usage examples in docstrings where helpful
- Maintain clear separation between educational content and code documentation
